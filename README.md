# Magic 8 Ball

>## My Goal

>The objective of this challenge is to apply the skills that I learned on the Dice app and get myself making an app with functionality all by myself.

>## What I created

>I created a Magic 8-ball app that used to be a thing back in the day. You simply ask questions and then press the button and it answers your question. Nothing too fancy but I still had to use my skills that I have learned so far to figure out how to create this app.
